## General pre-requisites

### Hardware

* 1 Drone (DJI Mavick Air around 800USD + tax ) - **must be this model** ([example](https://www.dji.com/mavic-air)). Other drones such as DJI Mavic Pro **are not supported**.
    * **If** Microsoft employee flying drone, then additional equipment includes:
        * 1 Xbox controller
        * 1 USB cable to connect controller to PC
        * 1 Shark fishing cable to restrain drone
        * Different build of the app - please contact ([Vlad Kolesnikov](mailto:vladkol@microsoft.com))

* 1 Windows Mixed Reality headset and controllers (Acer recommended due to flip-up visor, around 400USD + tax) ([example](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/d/acer-windows-mixed-reality-headset-with-motion-controllers/8ttsf1q97hkp?activetab=pivot%3aoverviewtab))

* 2 PCs - a 2nd PC is required for the VS Live Share demo - ideally you will have a switcher here to project both screens at once. Failing that you can run on a single PC, but you will need to be extra crisp about the scenario you are showing

### Software

* Windows 10 
    * April 2018 Update (1803, Build 17134); or, ideally:
